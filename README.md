Speak For Yersel tool

Speak For Yersel is a geospatial linguistic survey tool that enables internet users from a designated geographical area to answer multiple choice questions, with answers then being incorporated into interactive maps in real-time.  The tool provides a setup facility through which one or more morphology, lexis and phonology surveys featuring any number of questions can be created, plus facilities for exporting data from the tool once it is in use. Please refer to the 'Speak-for-Yersel-survey-setup-instructions' PDF for more information about the required data and an installation guide.
